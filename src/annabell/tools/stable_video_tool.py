# I had a different docker project that was running a stable diffusion API
# and I wanted to use it with the crewai framework. This is a tool that
# allows you to do that. It sends a request to the API and returns the
# path to the generated video. The API is expected to be running on
# localhost:7860. The API is expected to return a JSON response with
# a key "video_path" that contains the path to the generated video.
# This is not a complete implementation, but it should give you an idea of
# how I planned implement a tool that interacts with an external API.
