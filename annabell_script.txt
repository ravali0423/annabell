**Title: Anna Bell**  

**FADE IN:**  

**INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY**  

*The soft rays of the morning sun spill through half-drawn curtains into a cozy living room. A warm setting with purring sounds fills the air as ANNA, a sleek black cat adorned with a beautiful yet silent silver bell on her collar, brushes against the legs of her OWNER, who’s sipping on a cup of coffee.*  

**OWNER**  
(Chuckles)  
You’re such a sweetheart, Anna.  

*Anna jumps onto the owner's lap and curls up, her eyes half-closed in bliss. The camera pans to focus on the stillness of her bell.*  

**CUT TO:**  

**INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT**  

*The room is now bathed in the cold, indifferent glow of moonlight. A grandfather clock ticks ominously in the background. The owner is fast asleep on a recliner, a book resting open on their chest. The room is eerily quiet—until, softly, the faint jingle of a bell is heard.*  

*The owner stirs, the sound tugging at the edges of consciousness.*  

**OWNER**  
(Murmurs, half-asleep)  
Anna?  

*The bell’s ringing grows slightly louder and more insistent.*  

**INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT**  

*The camera moves with deliberate slowness, exploring the shadowed hallway. The ringing becomes sporadic, stopping, then starting again, resonating through the silence.*  

*The owner, now fully awake, rises from the recliner and follows the sound with an increasing sense of unease.*  

**OWNER**  
Anna? Where are you, girl?  

*The bell leads the owner to the closed door of the basement. A shiver runs through them as they grasp the handle, hesitating.*  

**INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT**  

*The door creaks open, spilling weak light onto the steps leading down. The bell is now a constant, unnerving presence. The owner takes cautious steps into the basement, each creak amplified by the empty space.*  

*They reach the bottom, the light switch flicks, bulb flickers, then steadies. Underneath a rickety shelf, a narrow gap reveals glowing eyes and the gentle swish of a tail. Anna emerges, the bell ringing freely—a haunting melody.*  

*A feeling of dread fills the owner, a shadow behind Anna looms larger and larger...*  

**OWNER**  
(Terrified)  
Anna, stop it...  

*Suddenly, the shadow shifts into a grotesque figure that mirrors Anna's movements like a dark twin. The bell’s ringing intensifies, a symphony of terror—Anna’s eyes glow with an unearthly light.*  

**OWNER**  
(Screams)  
What’s happening?!  

*The bell reaches a deafening crescendo as the apparition lunges towards the owner, then—*  

**CUT TO BLACK.**  

**The sound of the bell abruptly stops. Silence.**  

**FADE OUT.**
